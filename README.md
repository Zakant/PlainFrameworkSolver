# PlainFrameworkSolver
## What is this
This project aims to create and solve plain frameworks with standard mechanic methods. Its possible to create a framework either by a visual point and click editor or by using a _XML_ or _JSON_ based format.
All forces are calculated and returned. Also this application offers an export to `MatLab` code to process highly complicated frameworks with it.

**Note:** Although possible `MatLab` is not required to solve a framework. Its just an additional tool. Basic solving is already build-in!

Please also note that this software is still under active development and may miss features mentioned above.
